## Drawback of this webpage

The article title and paragraph are both statis - we will need to make updates to the html everytime there should be a change, if we have a link for the title and paragraph to make updates - the webpage would be most updated.

## Additional recommendations for further development

1. One reccomendation would be to use a scroll bar for the data box.
2. A link for the title and paragraph rather than copied information this would have a the most updated webpage.
